      <h2>Fishing</h2>
      <p>
        Fishing has recently become my favorite and only recreational hobby. It
        is the <strong>most</strong> enjoyabale way for me to get out in nature
        and find some semblance of peace in the world. I even invested in a
        GoPro to do vlogs. I am a frequent shopper at
        <a href="https://www.basspro.com/shop/en#">Bass Pro Shop</a> and
        <a href="https://www.academy.com/">Academy Sports</a>

      </p>
      <p>
        Im by no means good at fishing. In fact, it is one of the few hobbies i
        have and i don't do it for personal glory. But enjoy the glory in
        natures beauty. Sitting bankside with great friends and having a beer
        while waiting for a bite..

      <h2>Music Production</h2>

      <p>
        My interest in making music started at a young age while i took piano
        lessons. Initially, I was against learning how to play. Maybe it was
        because for first time I had to practice to get better. It wasnt instant
        gratification. But what I learned is too appreciate growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feeling like it was the only thing at the time I was passionate about
        enough to earn my Bachelors, I attended college. There i developed a
        thirst for knowledge on all aspects of music creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned how to maniuplate sound for foley and game design. Music
        composition was something personal though. This is when I learned how to
        express myself artisticly. It was therapy as well. It brought me joy.

      <h2>Gaming</h2>
      <p>
        It started with computer games in the 80s before I got my first console,
        an Atari. My favorite games were Chopper city, and Pacman.

      <br />
      <p>
        I went through all the consoles. Nintendo was one of my favorite
        consoles. I was a master (so i thoguht) at DuckHunt. I also loved to
        play Who framed Roger Rabbit. Not too many remember that game. Here is
        some game play to
        <em>check it out below!:</em>

        Now, I am more of a social gamer. So multiplayer is my go to. It all
        started with the Call of Duty franchise. Being a onlu child, I remember
        playing the first COD and thinking how awesome it was to play with
        people around the world. First person shooters had a great run and still
        play from time to time. Now I spend most my gaming time playing Ark
        Survivial on my Playsation. I aslo enjoy my Occulus from time to time.
