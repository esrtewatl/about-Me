    <h2>Fishing</h2>
    <p>
      The most enjoyabale way to get out in nature and find osme semblance of
      peace. Fishing has recently become my favorite and only recreational
      hobby. I even invested in a go pro to do vlogs.</p><p>Im by no means good at it.
      In fact, it is one of the few hobbies i have and i don't do it for
      personal glory. But enjoy the glory in natures beauty. </p>

    <h2>Music Production</h2>
    <p>
      My interet in making music started at a yound age when i took piano lessons. Initially I against learning how to play. 
      Maybe it was the first time I had to practice to get better. It wasnt instant gratification. But what I learned is too appreciate growth.</p>
      <p>Feeling like it was the only thing at the time I was passionate about enough to earn my Bachelors, I attended college. There i developed athirst for knowledge on all aspects of music creation.</p>
      <p>I learned how to maniuplate sound for foley and game design. Music composition was something personal though. This is when I learned how to express myself artisticly. It was therapy as well. It brought me joy.</p>
