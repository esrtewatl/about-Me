    <h1>My Interest & Hobbies</header>
    <h2>Fishing</h2>
    <p>
      Fishing has recently become my favorite and only recreational
      hobby. It is the  <strong>most</strong> enjoyabale way for me to get out in nature and find some semblance of
      peace int he world.  I even invested in a go pro to do vlogs.</p><p>Im by no means good at it.
      In fact, it is one of the few hobbies i have and i don't do it for
      personal glory. But enjoy the glory in natures beauty. </p>

    <h2>Music Production</h2>
    <p>
      My interet in making music started at a yound age when i took piano lessons. Initially I against learning how to play. 
      Maybe it was the first time I had to practice to get better. It wasnt instant gratification. But what I learned is too appreciate growth.</p>
      <p>Feeling like it was the only thing at the time I was passionate about enough to earn my Bachelors, I attended college. There i developed athirst for knowledge on all aspects of music creation.</p>
      <p>I learned how to maniuplate sound for foley and game design. Music composition was something personal though. This is when I learned how to express myself artisticly. It was therapy as well. It brought me joy.</p>

      <h2>Gaming</h2>
      It started with computer games in the 80s before I got my first console, an Atari. My favorite games were Chopper city, and Pacman. <img src="atarigames.jpg" alt="OldSchool Atari Games" class="atari">. I went through all the consoles. Nintendo was one of my favorite consoles. I was a master (so i thoguht) at DuckHunt. I also loved to play Who framed ROger Rabbit. Not too many remember that game. Here is some game play <a href="https://youtu.be/M9CcXdmsMJ0">Click here to check it out!</a>
