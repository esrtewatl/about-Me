    <h2>Fishing</h2>
    <p>
      The most enjoyabale way to get out in nature and find osme semblance of
      peace. Fishing has recently become my favorite and only recreational
      hobby. I even invested in a go pro to do vlogs. Im by no means good at it.
      In fact, it is one of the few hobbies i have and i don't do it for
      personal glory. But enjoy the glory in natures beauty. Sitting bankside
      with great friends and having a beer while waiting for bite. Talking about
      all the things we've done,knowing each moment is precious.
